                  <p>This project involves creating a motion graphic video to share tips on organization and minimalism 
                    inspired by the Konmari Method. The video emphasizes clear visuals and an engaging style to convey its message effectively.</p>
                  <p>Tools: Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator</p>

                  <h2>What I learned</h2>
                  <p>
                    This was my first full-graphic motion project. 
                    I learned the importance of thorough planning at the beginning. 
                    I had to reorganize the layers of graphics in Illustrator
                    after starting to animate them in After Effects. 
                    A well-considered organization of layers in Illustrator makes animating graphics much easier later on. <br />
                    On the other hand, I spent time deciding on the style of the graphics during the planning phase. 
                    This decision paid off, as it kept the projectâ€™s style consistent and 
                    prevented any confusion during the drawing process. 
                  </p>
                  <h2>What's next</h2>
                  <p>
                    In this project, I focused on applying the skills I gained, 
                    and other students' projects gave me a lot of inspiration. 
                    Moving forward, I would like to explore more techniques for better animations.
