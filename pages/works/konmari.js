                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                        <p>Using After Effects, I crafted a brief instructional video on meditation. 
                          Beginning with conceptualization, I outlined the scenes, graphics, and voiceover needed for the video. 
                          With a clear plan in place, I brought the project to life in After Effects, 
                          blending visual elements and narration to create an engaging and informative piece.</p>

                        <h2>What I learned</h2>
                        <p>
                          This was my first full-graphic motion project. 
                          I learned the importance of thorough planning at the beginning. 
                          I had to reorganize the layers of graphics in Illustrator
                          after starting to animate them in After Effects. 
                          A well-considered organization of layers in Illustrator makes animating graphics much easier later on. <br />
                          On the other hand, I spent time deciding on the style of the graphics during the planning phase. 
                          This decision paid off, as it kept the projectâ€™s style consistent and 
                          prevented any confusion during the drawing process. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>What's next</h2>
                        <p>
                          In this project, I focused on applying the skills I gained, 
                          and other students' projects gave me a lot of inspiration. 
                          Moving forward, I would like to explore more techniques for better animations.
